# Flight Status Analysis using OLAP

**Project Duration:** October 2024 - December 2024

This project involved analyzing flight status data in Australia by building a data warehouse and applying Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) techniques.

## Key Components:

* **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Preprocessed and integrated flight data using Python and SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services).
* **OLAP & Data Modeling:** Designed a multidimensional database and implemented SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services) for efficient querying and analytical processing.
* **Visualization & Reporting:** Created interactive dashboards in Power BI, Google Data Studio, and Excel Pivot, utilizing MDX Queries for deep analysis and insightful reporting.
* **Data Mining:** Applied Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithms to predict flight status, enhancing predictive capabilities.
